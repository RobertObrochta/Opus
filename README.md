# Opus
An app for musicians that allows users to record up to 1 minute long videos in response to prompts. These prompts are meant to log a user's practice session, and when responding to these prompts, the users can post publicly to share their musical advice. 

# Usage
This app can be used for any musician that is seeking advice about being a more holistic musician. This is a forum of sorts, except that rather than reading words on a screen, you interact with others through a more engaging form of social media: videos. In these videos, musicians are encouraged to talk about advice, perform excerpts, ask for feedback, and post snippets of upcoming gigs.
